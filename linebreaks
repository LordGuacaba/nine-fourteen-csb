HI CHRIS!
I'm doing linebreaks now. I feel like theres an actual coding way to do them, but for now I'm
just pressing enter randomly. Feel free to let me know how (it's probably different for each
language, I figure). Anyways, enough with the linebreaks. I tried to tell you where to find the 
keys to the puzzle, but I'm afraid the instructions took a detour through my layered shift program...

See, I even put linebreaks in my clue! I hope this helps. QUACK! (That's not the decryption key, I'm just saying it).
QUACK!
QUACK!
